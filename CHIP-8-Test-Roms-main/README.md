# CHIP-8-Test-Roms

## Test Suites
in order to validate the implementation of the CHIP-8, we will use two test suites
- [c8 Tests](https://github.com/Skosulor/c8int/tree/master/test)
- [Timendus Test Suite](https://github.com/Timendus/chip8-test-suite)

they will test opcodes, memory, and the timers thus enabling you to verify the implementation of the CHIP-8 you have made.  
the other roms are games or demos that you can use to test your CHIP-8 implementation especially for the graphics and the keyboard.
